# Spacecraft_design
This project is from the course "Spacecraft design and system engineering" taught by Muriel Richard in 2019. The objective is to design the phase 0 of a spacecraft mission of our choice.

I chose to work on a lunar orbiter to be used as a relay for futur lunar exploration missions.

This repository contains the final presentation and report, the simulation files used to design the mission, and the system engineering files (budgets and block diagrams).
